# Fundamentals of Quantum Gates

This section introduces **quantum gates**, the building blocks of quantum circuits.  
It covers both single-qubit gates and the importance of two-qubit gates.

## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Goals
- Gain hands-on experience with **single-qubit gates** (X, Y, Z, H, etc.).  
- Explore the role of **two-qubit gates** (CNOT, CZ) in entanglement.  
- Understand why multi-qubit gates are essential for universal quantum computing.
